    - The node_modules folder contains all the project's dependencies installed by npm.
    - The public folder holds the static assets, including the index.html file, which is the entry point of our app.
    - The src folder is where we'll do most of our work. It contains the main application files, including the App.js component, which is the root component of our app.



npm : node package module : we can install either local or global

//////////////////////////////
Step to install package.json
//////////////////////////////

1. install node.js
2. navigate to folder where you want to create
3. npm init
4. answer all question
5. type yes

///////////////////////////////
Step to install local packages
///////////////////////////////
A local package is installed in a specific project or directory, and is usually referenced only within that project. It is typically stored in a folder like node_modules (for Node.js) or a virtual environment (for Python).

1. navigate to folder
2. npm install <package_name> : npm install react / npm i react
Note : React is open source, one package is depends on another so we got so many folders or files when we install react.

///////////////////////////////
Step to install local packages
///////////////////////////////
A global package is installed on your system so that it can be accessed from anywhere on your machine, regardless of the project. Itâ€™s available for any project or task that requires it.

npm i -g create-react-app
