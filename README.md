Step to install local packages
///////////////////////////////
A local package is installed in a specific project or directory, and is usually referenced only within that project. It is typically stored in a folder like node_modules (for Node.js) or a virtual environment (for Python).

1. navigate to folder
2. npm install <package_name> : npm install react / npm i react
Note : React is open source, one package is depends on another so we got so many folders or files when we install react.

///////////////////////////////
Step to install local packages
///////////////////////////////
A global package is installed on your system so that it can be accessed from anywhere on your machine, regardless of the project. Itâ€™s available for any project or task that requires it.

npm i -g create-react-app
